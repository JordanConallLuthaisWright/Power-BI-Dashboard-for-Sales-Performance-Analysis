# Power BI Dashboard: Sales Performance Analysis (2022-2024)

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard was created to showcase my proficiency in developing data-driven insights and creating interactive visualizations. It was designed as a prototype during my internship as a **Creative Copywriter Intern at Nude Project** to demonstrate my technical skills in Power BI.

The project analyzes fictional sales data (sourced from the publicly available **`Plant.DTS.xls`** file on Kaggle) for XYZ Company, covering the years 2022-2024. This dashboard is not based on real data and was created solely to highlight my knowledge of data modeling, visualization, and storytelling using Power BI.

## Key Features
1. **Heat Map Visualization**:
   - Highlights the **bottom 10** performing product categories for **Year-To-Date (YTD)** vs **Previous Year-To-Date (PYTD)** in terms of quantity, gross profit, and sales.
   
2. **Waterfall Chart**:
   - Provides a detailed monthly comparison of sales segmented by **country** and **product**, identifying performance trends and opportunities.

3. **Line & Stacked Column Chart**:
   - Visualizes **monthly** and **quarterly** trends for **quantity**, **gross profit**, and **sales**, offering a comprehensive view of overall performance.

4. **Scatter Chart**:
   - Analyzes profitability segmentation by plotting **Gross Profit %** and **Gross Profit** for key product categories, enabling the identification of high- and low-performing segments.
